            <ol>
                <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta or noodles of your
                    choice then cook until al dente (usually 9-12 minutes). Reserve half a cup of pasta water and drain.
                </li>

                <li>How to cook chicken for chicken Alfredo: Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts on a chopping
                    board and carefully slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to create two thin cutlets.
                    Drizzle each piece of chicken with olive oil then season generously on both sides with 2 teaspoons
                    of Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Heat a large frying pan or skillet over
                    medium-high heat then add the chicken and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and
                    cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>

                <li>
                    Make the Alfredo sauce: In the same pan over medium heat, melt a few tablespoons butter and add the
                    crushed garlic. Scrape the bottom of the pan to bring up any golden bits from the chicken (this is a
                    serious flavor bomb and tastes great in the finished sauce). Cook for 30 seconds then pour in the
                    cream
                    and add the remaining Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook for 5 minutes then
                    remove
                    from the heat and add the Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine then season with salt and pepper.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Combine: Slice the chicken with a sharp knife into thin strips then add to the Alfredo sauce.
                    Combine
                    the sauce and chicken with cooked pasta along with a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water and
                    toss
                    to coat. Serve sprinkled with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.
